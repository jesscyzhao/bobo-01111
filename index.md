# Bodhi Lal-Zhao

## Introduction

We wanted her name to be semantically meaningful and consistent in English, Chinese and Nepali, which turns out to be a non-trival task. Apoorva came up with a zero-shot solution: Bodhi, the tree under which the Budhha attained enlightenment, which phonetically translates to 博迪 (boe-dee) in Chinese, meaning extensive enlightment. And Chunyi happily agreed.
